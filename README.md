# Plagiarism-Detection-Udacity
This is my repository for submitting my Plagiarism Detection project from Udacity's ML Engineer Track


Files In this repository:


This was another project that was part of my Udacity machine learning degree, for this project are used NLP processing techniques to analyze the content of mock submitted papers. By comparing the similarity of the words and syntax used in the training set of papers, I constructed a binary classification model which was able to classify new, Unseen mock papers as either low plagiarism, medium plagiarism, or high plagiarism.
This is a great model which I can retrofit in different ways for different but similar real world  tasks.
Enjoy! You can always contact me if you have any questions :)
